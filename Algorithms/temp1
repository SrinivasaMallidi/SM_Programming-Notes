Subject: Assistance Needed: "LoadError - Frame Load Interrupted" Error in Maximo Anywhere Application

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek assistance regarding an issue encountered in our Maximo Anywhere application. We are currently facing an error message that states "LoadError - Frame Load Interrupted" when users attempt to view attachments within the application.

Previously, attachments were stored within the Maximo servers at the location "/app/IBM/doclinks/", and users were able to download and view the attachments seamlessly from their iPads. However, recent changes have resulted in attachments being stored in a different application. Consequently, when users try to view attachments, the application navigates to the new location, leading to the aforementioned error message.

Our primary objective is to understand the root cause of this error and find a solution to enable users to view attachments smoothly within the Maximo Anywhere application. We seek your expertise and support in identifying the cause of the "LoadError - Frame Load Interrupted" error and implementing necessary measures to resolve it.

Any insights, guidance, or assistance you can provide in addressing this issue would be greatly appreciated. Please let us know if any additional information or access is required from our end to facilitate the investigation and resolution process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to your prompt response and support.
