Topic Description: Equipment Run Hours

Requirements:

Accurate recording of equipment run hours.
Generation of preventive maintenance (PM) work orders based on actual equipment run hours.
Integration with PI (Process Information) system to retrieve equipment run hour data.
Automation of PM work order generation based on actual equipment run hours.
Technologies (Software/Hardware):

PI system for capturing equipment run hour data.
Integration middleware for communication between PI system and maintenance system (e.g., Maximo).
Maintenance management software (e.g., Maximo) for PM work order generation and management.
Business Benefits:

Improved maintenance scheduling: PM work orders are generated based on actual equipment usage, ensuring maintenance tasks are performed when needed and not unnecessarily.
Increased equipment reliability: Regular maintenance based on actual run hours reduces the risk of unexpected breakdowns and prolongs equipment lifespan.
Cost savings: Eliminating unnecessary PM work orders reduces maintenance costs associated with labor, parts, and downtime.
Enhanced asset performance: Maintenance activities aligned with actual equipment usage optimize asset performance and availability.
