Topic Description: Business Process Reengineering - Integrated Asset Performance Management

Requirements:

Integration between Asset Management System (AMS) and Integrated Management System (IMS).
Automated synchronization process (interface) between IMS and AMS to exchange critical asset and maintenance data.
Transfer of data from IMS to AMS including critical locations, assets, preventive maintenance (PM) tasks, and work order (WO) information.
Transfer of data from AMS to IMS including functional locations, equipment, inspection tasks, and work order history.
Technologies (Software/Hardware):

Integration middleware for data exchange between AMS and IMS.
Asset management software (e.g., Maximo) for managing maintenance activities and work orders.
Integrated management software (e.g., Meridium) for performance monitoring and analysis.
Business Benefits:

Enhanced decision-making: Integration of asset performance data from IMS into AMS provides a holistic view of asset health, enabling data-driven decision-making.
Improved asset reliability: Access to critical asset information and maintenance tasks from IMS allows for proactive maintenance planning and optimization of asset reliability.
Streamlined processes: Automated synchronization between AMS and IMS streamlines data exchange processes, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.
Increased efficiency: Integration of functional location and equipment data from AMS into IMS improves the accuracy of performance monitoring and analysis, leading to more efficient asset management practices.
